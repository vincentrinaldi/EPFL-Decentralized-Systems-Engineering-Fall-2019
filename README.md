# Project of Decentralized Systems Engineering (CS-438)

## EPFL Fall 2019

### Description

**Poorster** is a peer-to-peer decentralized, encrypted, cluster-wide, anonymous messaging and audio streaming application with custom e-voting. 

This project focuses on creating clustering for the peers.
A cluster can then accept new members, or remove exisiting ones with a **voting** protocol.
Inside a cluster, peers can communicate with **Confidentiality** and **Anonymity**.
